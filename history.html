        <h1><center>History</center></h1>
        <p>Ballet, theatrical dance in which a formal academic dance 
        technique—the danse d’école—is combined with other artistic 
        elements such as music, costume, and stage scenery. The academic
        technique itself is also known as ballet. This article surveys 
        the history of ballet.</p>

        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>Ballet originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 
            <strong>15th century</strong>. Noblemen and women were treated to lavish 
            events, especially wedding celebrations, where dancing and 
            music created an elaborate spectacle. Dancing masters taught 
            the steps to the nobility, and the court participated in the 
            performances. In the <strong>16th century</strong>, <em>Catherine de Medici</em> — 
            an Italian noblewoman, wife of <em>Henry II of France</em>  and a 
            great patron of the arts — began to fund ballet in the French 
            court. Her elaborate festivals encouraged the growth of ballet 
            de cour, a program that included  dance, decor, costume, song, 
            music and poetry. A century later, <em>King Louis XIV</em> helped to 
            popularize and standardize the art form.
        </p>
        <p>By <strong>1661</strong>, a dance academy had opened in <em>Paris</em>, and in 1681 
            ballet moved from the courts to the stage. <em>The French
            opera Le Triomphe de l’Amour</em> incorporated ballet 
             elements, creating a long-standing opera-ballet 
             tradition in France.
        </p>

        <h3>The 19th century</h3>
        <p>
            Early classical ballets such as <em>Giselle</em> and <em>La Sylphide</em> were 
            created during the Romantic Movement in the first half of 
            the 19th century. This movement influenced art, music and 
            ballet. It was concerned with the supernatural world of 
            spirits and magic and often showed women as passive and 
            fragile. These themes are reflected in the ballets of the 
            time and are called romantic ballets. This is also the 
            period of time when dancing on the tips of the toes, known 
            as pointe work, became the norm for the ballerina. The 
            romantic tutu, a calf-length, full skirt made of tulle, was 
            introduced.

        <p>
            The popularity of ballet soared in Russia, and, during the 
            latter half of the 19th century, Russian choreographers and 
            composers took it to new heights. <em>Marius Petipa’s</em> 
            <em>The Nutcracker</em>, <em>The Sleeping Beauty</em> and <em>Swan Lake</em>, by
            <em>Petipa</em> and <em>Lev Ivanov</em>, represent classical ballet in its 
            grandest form. The main purpose was to display classical 
            technique — pointe work, high extensions, precision of 
            movement and turn-out (the outward rotation of the legs 
            from the hip)—to the fullest. Complicated sequences that 
            show off demanding steps, leaps and turns were choreographed 
            into the story.
