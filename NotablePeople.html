                    In 1988, she was given the title role in a production 
                    of Giselle staged by the Royal Ballet to celebrate 
                    Nureyev's 50th birthday. Her performance was a success,
                     and in the following year she left Paris for London, 
                     to become a freelance performer and one of the Royal 
                     Ballet's principal guest artists. Her desire to work 
                     independently from a company gained her the nickname 
                     "Mademoiselle Non"

                    In 2000, Rojo was asked at short notice to replace 
                    the injured Royal Ballet principal Darcey Bussell in 
                    the title role in Giselle. Ignoring her own sprained 
                    ankle, Rojo learned the role in a fortnight and went 
                    on to receive rave reviews. In 2002, while dancing 
                    Clara in Nutcracker, Rojo began to tremble on stage. 
                    Sent to a private hospital after the performance, she 
                    learned her appendix had burst and was told to take six 
                    weeks off. However, she resumed dancing after only two, 
                    relapsed and returned to hospital. Rojo admitted some 
                    years later it was "completely wrong [to continue dancing 
                    while injured or ill] and I do not feel that anyone should 
                    do this. It really is not worth it."
