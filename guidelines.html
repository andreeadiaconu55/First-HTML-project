    <h1><center>Basic principles</center></h1>
    <p>The Rules of Classical Dance were first set down definitively by 
        John Weaver in 1723. Each generation has had its great teachers 
        of ballet who have added insights and details to these rules and 
        principles. These principles are essential for the dancer to learn 
        around the age of 9 or 10. Their learning, at this point, has 
        progressed to a point where they can now start to grasp the 
        big-picture concepts that are essential to their understanding of 
        classical ballet. You will find a link at the bottom of this page 
        for a free download of this article in PDF format for use in your 
        ballet class.</p>

            <li>Knee remains in natural alignment with leg and foot, whether bent or straight.</li>
            <li>Ankle joints must flex and extend in line with the knee joints — no inversion or eversion.</li>

            Balance

            <li>
                Epaulement:
                <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
                    <li>Natural — the leg in front is matched by a slight forward movement of the same shoulder.</li>
                    <li>Opposition — the opposite shoulder moves slightly forward.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The weight is evenly distributed throughout the body, using the least amount of energy for the balancing as is possible.</li>
        </ul>
